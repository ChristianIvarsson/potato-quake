# WIP of a stripped down Quake - Not usable atm

# Aim is to run it on ESP32 /w 4 megs of PSRAM but there's still not enough ram freed for a full frame / Z-buffer


# PS:
# /pi is mostly just for quick checking since I needed a 32-bit target with heavier debugging facilities
# Had to remove all history and create a fresh repo due to way too many pak files that had been thrown around in various folders. -Sorry
